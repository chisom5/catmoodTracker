# Cat Mood Tracker

## Instructions

First screen shows an empty state of the app when the mood was not tracked at all. After the user picks one of the three emoji’s on the left and clicks “Submit”, the matching mood card should appear on the right side on top of the column. After it appears, the left mood tracker should again have no mood selected and go back to the previous state. After each submitted mood, the new card should appear on top of the others. It is fine if the app comes back to an empty state after refreshing the page.
